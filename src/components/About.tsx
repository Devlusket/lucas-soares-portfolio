        I am a student learning front-end development, currently focused on becoming a <strong>full-stack developer</strong>. I love building websites and web apps that look good and work well.<br /><br />
        I know <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and <strong>TypeScript</strong>, and I have been working with tools like <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Tailwind</strong>, <strong>Next.js</strong>, <strong>Vite</strong>, <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>Git</strong> and <strong>GitHub</strong>. I also know the basics of <strong>Vue.js</strong> and <strong>Angular</strong>.<br /><br />
        For design, I use <strong>Figma</strong> and <strong>Canva</strong> to put together clean and simple layouts.<br /><br />
        I have also started exploring the <strong>backend</strong> side of things, and I know the basicsâ€”like using packages such as <strong>json-server</strong> to create fake APIs and simulate a database.<br /><br />
        Right now, I am learning, improving, and creating cool projects as I grow my skills. Always up for a new challenge and ready to work!
